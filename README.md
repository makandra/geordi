Geordi
======

Geordi is a collection of command line tools we use in our daily work with
Ruby, Rails and Linux at [makandra](http://makandra.com/).

Installing the `geordi` gem will install some binaries (see below):

    gem install geordi


geordi

The base command line utility offering most of the commands.

You may abbreviate commands by typing only the first letter(s), e.g. `geordi
dev` will boot a development server, `geordi s -t` will setup a project and run
tests afterwards. Underscores and dashes are equivalent.

For details on commands, e.g. supported options, run `geordi help <command>`.

Copy `lib/geordi/COMMAND_TEMPLATE` to `lib/geordi/commands/your_command` and
edit it to do what you need it to do. Usually, it is hard to automatedly test
Geordi commands, so make sure you've manually tested it.

Don't forget to update this README. The whole `geordi` section is auto-generated
by `rake update_readme`.
