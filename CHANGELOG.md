# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

- Fixed #115: `geordi cucumber --modified` command, that corrupts filenames like:
  ```
  No such file or directory tures/pages.feature
  ```

### Compatible changes

* added `auto_update_chromedriver` as global setting option to automatically update chromedriver before cucumber 
  tests, if Chrome and chromedriver versions don't match. 
### Breaking changes


## 4.1.1 2020-08-28
### Compatible changes

* Fixed: System calls are not executed properly if no bin stub is present. This resulted in errors like:

  ```
  % geordi rspec

  # Running specs
  > All specs at once (using parallel_tests)

  x Specs failed.
  ```

  or

  ```
  % geordi migrate

  # Migrating
  > Development and parallel test databases

  x Something went wrong.
  ```


## 4.1.0 2020-08-18

### Compatible changes

- Added dumple option `--compress` to compress after dumping

## 4.0.1 2020-08-11

### Compatible changes

- Fix `geordi migrate` command, that fails with:

```
Don't know how to build task 'db:migrate parallel:prepare'
```


## 4.0.0 2020-07-30

### Compatible changes
- Improved documentation; README now includes command options.
- Fix #90: `geordi console`, `geordi deploy`, `geordi rake` and `geordi shell` now work correctly if the project hasn't been bundled before

### Breaking changes
- Removed deprecated executables
- Removed `eurest` command
- Respect binstubs if available, otherwise fallback to geordi's previous behaviour. Note that this might cause failures, when your binstubs are not working. Please have a look at #109 for how a failure might look like and how you can fix it.


## 3.2.0 2020-07-15

### Compatible changes
- Improvement #43: `--select-server` option on `geordi shell` and `geordi console` can take the number of the server to connect to it directly and to skip the menu.
- Add a `.geordi.yml` file to change multiple settings in the project and  `~/.config/geordi/global.yml` for global settings.
- Deprecated the `.pt_project_id` file in favor of `.geordi.yml`.
- Deprecated the `~/.gitpt` file in favor of `~/.config/geordi/global.yml`.
- Add #91: Now there is an option to start cucumber without a VNC session. This is configured by the .geordi.yml file.
- Fixed `git#staged_changes?` detection on Ruby < 2.5.


## 3.1.0 2020-06-03

### Compatible changes
- Update security-update for improved workflow (#89): Deploy staging first and ask user, if application is still running. Then deploy other stages.


## 3.0.3 2020-05-27

### Compatible changes
- Fix #98: Changing the `config/database.yml` reader from `YAML.load` to `YAML.safe_load` dropped the support for aliases. We now allow aliases and the classes `Time` and `Symbol`. If we encounter further issues with this approach a revert to `YAML.load` would be an option, too.


## 3.0.2 2020-05-18

### Compatible changes
- Fix #95: Method change from `! *.include?` to `*.exclude?` was not valid as we do not have active support in Geordi. Affected commands were `geordi cucumber` and `geordi deploy`.


## 3.0.1 2020-05-13

### Compatible changes
- Fix #93: Using `$CHILDSTATUS` instead of `$?` did not work properly. This affected commands like `geordi drop-databases` to fail.
- Fix #92: Geordi fail messages were converted to exceptions by accident. Now they are printed as red error message without the backtrace again.


## 3.0.0 2020-05-04

### Breaking changes
- Remove support for Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.3. Bug fixes might still be backported to 2.x, but we will not add any features to 2.x anymore. Please consider to upgrade the Ruby version of your project.


## 2.11.0 2020-05-04

### Compatible changes
- Added the possibility to change the Rails root for the capistrano config via the environment variable `RAILS_ROOT`. This allows you as a gem developer to run a command like `RAILS_ROOT=~/Projects/my-blog geordi console staging` whereas `geordi` uses the capistrano config from `my-blog`. Otherwise you would need to follow the instructions of [this card](https://makandracards.com/makandra/46617-how-to-use-a-local-gem-in-your-gemfile) to test changes in the gem locally.
- Bug fix for "no staged changes" even if there are changes present (#83).
- Fixed deprecation warning for `Thor exit with status 0 on errors` (#84).
- Replaced `Bundler.with_unbundled_env` with `Bundler.with_original_env` (#77). This is a better replacement than 42cd1c4.
- Add deprecation warning `Deprecation warning: Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.3 support will be dropped in Geordi 3.x.` to Geordi 2.
- Fix error `thor requires Ruby version >= 2.0.0` for Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.3 (https://github.com/makandra/geordi/issues/79#issuecomment-598664191).

## 2.4.0 2019-10-21

### Compatible changes
- [#56](https://github.com/makandra/geordi/issues/56): Add current branch option to "deploy" command. This actually sets the `DEPLOY_BRANCH` variable to the current branch during deployment. The deployed application needs to pick up this variable in the respective Capistrano stage file. Example: `set :branch, ENV['DEPLOY_BRANCH'] || 'master'`

    primary: true
  ```
