Example: `geordi branch`

On the first execution we ask for your Pivotal Tracker API token and for your Git user initials. Both will be
stored in `~/.config/geordi/global.yml`.

You can filter the stories by owner by adding `pivotal_tracker_owner_filter: <your pivotal tracker username>` to your `~/.config/geordi/global.yml`.
This filter can be skipped with the `-o` option.
