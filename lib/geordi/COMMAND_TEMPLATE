# This file serves as a template for adding new commands.
# For more inspiration, see already implemented commands.

# Since commands can be invoked by only typing their first letters, please try
# to find a command name that has a unique prefix.

desc 'command ARG [OPTIONAL]', 'one-line description'
long_desc <<-LONGDESC # optional
Start with an example: `command bla bla`

Detailed description with anything the user needs to know.

Short and long description are printed on the console AND included in the README
by `rake update_readme`. Thus, please format descriptions in a way that's reader
friendly both in Markdown and the console.
LONGDESC

option :opt, :type => :boolean, :aliases => '-o', :banner => 'VALUE_NAME',
       :desc => 'If set, VALUE_NAME will be used for something'

def setup
  # Invoke other commands like this:
  invoke_cmd 'other_command', 'argument', :an => 'option'

  fail 'Option missing' unless options.opt?

  # For formatted output, see geordi/interaction.rb
  success 'Done.'
