  Scenario: Using the @solo tag

    The cucumber command runs all features without the @solo tag. If any of the
    specified .feature files contains '@solo', it boots Cucumber a second time
    and runs only those of the features tagged with @solo.

  Scenario: When called with line numbers, the @solo extra run is skipped

    Note that with line numbers in the passed file names, features are run
    serially.
